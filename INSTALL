Installation
------------

Hoa  Framework  requires  no  special  installation  steps.  Simply download the
framework  archive,  extract  it,  and  the  “installation”  is over. If it is a
SVN checkout, the installation is already done.


One framework, two ways of using
--------------------------------

  Set of libraires

Hoa  Framework  can  be  used  partially,  i.e.  you should used just one or two
packages  (with their dependences), and included them in an other project. Then,
the    command-line    is    useless,    the    hoa://Data    folder    is   not
needed. In these conditions, Hoa is used like a set of libraries.

  Standalone mode

Hoa  Framework  can also be used entirely, i.e. with all these packages. In this
case,    packages    will    search    their    configuration   files   in   the
hoa://Data/Etc/Configuration  folder  by  default  (and  if exists) for example,
the  command-line  interface  will  be  operational  etc.  In  these conditions,
Hoa is used like a frame for working… a framework !


System requirement
------------------

Hoa Framework requires PHP 5.1.4 or later. A PHP 5.2.x version is adviced!
Hoa Framework uses some SPL libraries, they must all be present.
Note that PHP 5.3 is well-supported.


Development versions
--------------------

Archived  snapshots  are online; please, go to <http://download.hoa-project.net>
to  get  more  details.  SVN  is  available at <http://svn.hoa-project.net>. You
should  look  the  /Framework/Trunk  or /Framework/Tags directories. If you only
want    to    take   a   look   at   the   SVN   repository,   please,   go   to
<http://svn-view.hoa-project.net>.


Configuring the include path
----------------------------

Once  a  copy of Hoa Framework is available, the application will need to access
the  framework  classes.  Though there are several ways to achieve this, the PHP
include_path  needs  to contains the path to the Hoa Framework classes under the
/Framework/Core directory.
You  can  find  out  more  about the PHP include_path configuration directive at
these addresses:
    * http://php.net/ini.core;
    * http://php.net/set_include_path,
or input:
    $ php --rf set_include_path
to get the function prototype.

For example, your bootstrap file should contain:
    set_include_path('./'               . PATH_SEPARATOR .
                     './Framework/Core' . PATH_SEPARATOR .
                     get_include_path())

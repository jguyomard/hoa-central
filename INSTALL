Installation
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Hoa requires no special installation steps. Simply download the project archive,
extract it, or clone the project, and the “installation” is over. We
recommend to install Hoa in /usr/local/lib/hoa (if your system respect FHS) or
C:\Program Files\Hoa\ if you are on Windows.

To test the installation:
  ┌
    $ php -r "require '/usr/local/lib/hoa/Core/Core.php'; var_dump(HOA);"
    bool(true)
  └


System requirement
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Hoa requires PHP5.3.0 or later. Hoa uses some SPL libraries, they must all be
present. Nevertheless, we recommend to use PHP5.3.8 with at least the following
configure command:
  ┌
    $ ./configure --prefix=… --with-config-file-path=… \
                  --with-zend-vm=GOTO --enable-fpm --enable-mbstring
  └

Mercurial. Its repositories are available at:

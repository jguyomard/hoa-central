Installation
------------

Hoa  Framework  requires  no  special  installation  steps.  Simply download the
framework archive, extract it, and the “installation” is over.


One framework, two ways of using
--------------------------------

  Set of libraires

Hoa  Framework  can  be  used  partially,  i.e.  you should used just one or two
packages  (with their dependences), and included them in an other project. Then,
the    command-line    is   useless,   the   /Data   folder   is   not   needed.
In these conditions, Hoa is used like a set of libraries.

  Standalone mode

Hoa  Framework  can also be used entirely, i.e. with all these packages. In this
case,    packages    will    search    their    configuration   files   in   the
/Data/Configuration/Cache  folder  by  default  (and if exists) for example, the
command-line  interface  will  be  operational  etc. In these conditions, Hoa is
used like a frame for working (… a framework !).


System requirement
------------------

Hoa Framework requires PHP 5.1.4 or later.
Hoa Framework uses some SPL libraries, they must be present.


Development versions
--------------------

Only  archived  snapshots  are online (please, go to <http://hoa-project.net> to
get more details).
The  SVN  support  is  currently (31 october 2008) down, but it will coming back
soon.


Configuring the include path
----------------------------

Once  a  copy of Hoa Framework is available, the application will need to access
the  framework  classes.  Though there are several ways to achieve this, the PHP
include_path  needs  to contains the path to the Hoa Framework classes under the
/Framework directory.
You  can  find  out  more  about the PHP include_path configuration directive at
these addresses :
    * http://php.net/ini.core ;
    * http://php.net/set_include_path,
or input :
    $ php --rf set_include_path
to get the function prototype.

For example, your bootstrap file should contain :
    set_include_path('./'            . PATH_SEPARATOR .
                     './Application' . PATH_SEPARATOR .
                     './Framework'   . PATH_SEPARATOR .
                     get_include_path())


Content
-------

  Root

At the Hoa Framework root, we can find :
    * /Data : that  contains  all  the “standalone” informations,  i.e. packages
      configuration files, binaries, templates etc. ;
    * /Framework : that contains libraries.

  Changelog, dependencies etc.

In  the  /Data/Etc  folder are placed the changelog and the dependency files (in
many   formats).  Changelog  contains  a  historic  of  the  SVN  repository  in
descending  order  of  revision  number.  Dependency  file  contains dependences
for each package in the framework (if exist).
Changelog and dependency files exist in many formats :
    * plain text :  without  any  decorations, patterns, very easy to understand
      for human reader ;
    * .echo :  same  presentation  like  the  plain  text  format, but with some
      colours.  Colours  will only be seen in a tty terminal, because we use the
      \e[[0-9]+m format. To see it in the terminal, input :
          /Data/Etc $ echo -e "`cat CHANGELOG.echo`"
      or
          /Data/Etc $ ./echoe CHANGELOG.echo
      it is equivalent.
    * .xml : structured presentation, very usefull for parsing, analysing,
      sharing etc.

  Configuration

When  Hoa  is  used  in “standalone” mode, each package that need configurations
will find it in the /Data/Configuration/Cache folder. Cache are in PHP format (a
simple   array),   but   the   configurations  source  is  in  YAML  format,  in
/Data/Configuration.
To rebuild configuration cache files, input :
    /Data/Bin $ ./hoa maintenance:cache
By default, all caches are generated.

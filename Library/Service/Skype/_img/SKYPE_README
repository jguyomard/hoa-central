Skype icons
===========

In order to present a consistent user experience to our users
we ask that external developers use the same icons in their
user interfaces that we use in the Skype Client.

To make this a bit simpler for you, we have published a list
of more than 100 icons in 5 image sizes. These icons are
contained in the 'icons' directory as PNG files, and licensed
to all developers under the Skype Component License.

This license allows you to use the icons free of charge in
your Skype-related products as long as you follow some simple
restrictions (e.g. you use the icons in the same way they are
used in Skype software, your product does not do anything evil,
and a few others). See LICENSE.txt for details.

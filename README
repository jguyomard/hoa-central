Release informations
--------------------

Hoa Framework 0.5.0b (582).
Released on 10 november 2009.


Special notices for upgrading
-----------------------------

  0.4.3b to 0.5.0b

All  packages  configurations system were modified according to the new rules of
hoa:// and zFormat. No backward-compatibility was possible, so take care to your
configuration files.

The  Hoa_Stream_Notification  has  a totally new behavior. Take care about that.
Its behavior is very close to Hoa_Stream_Context.

Prefere  to use PHP_VERSION* constantes instead of version_compare(phpversion(),
â€¦).

import()  and importModule() methods now throw exception in all cases (except if
file is found, or files are found ;-)).

The  Data/ architecture was totally recasted. Please, you should used the hoa://
to  access  in.  It is a  higher  abstract-level of the architecture and allow a
better portability.

The   Hoa_File  class  was  splitted  into  three  new  classes:  Hoa_File_Read,
Hoa_File_Write and Hoa_File_ReadWrite. Please, change it in your code :-).

  0.4.0b to 0.4.3b

The  Hoa_StdClass  has  been  changed.  Take  care of its behavior. Please, read
revisions 119, 120 and 121:
    /Data/Bin $ ./hoa changelog -r 121:-2 -t -c

The  Hoa_Stream  is up. Thus, the Hoa_File and Hoa_Socket were totally rewrited.
Please,  read  revisions  300, 302, 305, 310, 315, 316, 317, 318, 321, 322, 323,
326,  328, 329, 330, 338, 339, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363,
364, 365, 367, 372, 383, 384 and 385.

The   Hoa_Session_Exception_*  classes  are  now  well-named  and  have  a  good
inheritance. You can remove your tricks.

The Hoa_Stack package is dead. Please, see revision 346.

The Hoa_XmlRpc package is temporary depreciated! Please, see revision 389.

  0.3.7b to 0.4.0b

After  remaking  the  importation  system,  certain  packages have to be renamed
because  they  were not following Hoa naming conventions. Please, read revisions
301, 300, and 225, thank you :
    /Data/Bin $ ./hoa changelog -r 301,300,225 -t -c

New features in 0.5.0b
----------------------

Please,  read  the  changelog  from  the previous revision number to the current
prevision number :
    /Data/Bin $ ./hoa changelog -r HEAD:PREV -t -c

We can notice new packages, like Hoa_Memory, Hoa_Php, Hoa_Lo and Hoa_Tree.

But  definitively,  hoa://  and  zFormat  are  the two bigs new features of this
version.  On  these  ones, the new package pararameter system is based, and also
the  new  framework  architecture.  It  is  now  a real hybrid of frameworks and
libraries.
